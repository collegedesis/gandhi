## Gandhi Chrome Extension

This chrome extension looks for the text "Ghandi" on whatever page you're on and replaces it with the correct spelling "Gandhi".

**Gotcha**: If you have the extension enabled right now, the description above is really trying to say that "G handi" will be replaced with "Gandhi" (minus the space).
